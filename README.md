## How to play the game

A number of cards are placed face down in a grid in a random order. The cards have images
on their face and the cards are in pairs, with each pair having the same image.
Each turn the player turns over two cards. If they are a matching pair they remain face up. If
they donâ€™t match they are turned face down again.
The game finishes when all the pairs have been removed.
